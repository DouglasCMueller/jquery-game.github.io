Wild West RPG!
Developer: Douglas C. Mueller
This is an RPG style game with characters from the Wild West of the United States. It is written in javascript with a jquery library.  To play, the user clicks a "Good Guy" character.  User then gets a choice of "Bad Guy" characted to engage in a gun fight.  The player must defeat three "Bad Guys" in order to win the game.
issues:
1. I added "health points/attack power/counter attack power" to each gunfighter, but I didn't not put those values into the game play.
2. I added a reset button, but can't get it to work. 
3. When I created the character's images, I couldn't figure out how to add "health points" or "name" directly to the image <div>.
